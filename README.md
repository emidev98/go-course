# Go Journey

|-|-|
|This repository contains educative content related Go-lang. Starting from the basics to advanced use cases of the language with code snippets and explanations. <br> <br> I post all this information in GitHub because that way I have to dig a into language specific feature and not just reading thru internet and/or copying random code from different websites. <br> <br>  While checking the repo if there is something missing or can be improved feel free to send a pull request or open an issue in this same repo. | <img src="./gopher.png"> |
